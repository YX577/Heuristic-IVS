# Heuristic-IVS
Deriving operating rules for multi-objective cascade reservoir is an important problem in water resources management. To address this problem, this study combines the radial basis function network (RBFN) with an evolutionary algorithm to propose the heuristic input variable selection (HIS) method that extracts the operating rules of cascade reservoirs based on feature selection.
